<b><font size="5"><font color="magenta">Whats Online Gaming?</b> 
<p><font size="3"><font color="black">Online gaming describes any video game that offers online interactions with other players. Video games used t
o be classified by an Online Content PEGI descriptor to signify whether they were online or not. However, as most games now provide online interactions this distinction is no longer used.
What is still different game to game, is the level of interaction on offer. How much information players share and how many people they interact with are the two key factors for parents to be aware of.
Offers clear benefits for children
Online games are important to understand because they offer a huge amount of fun, enjoyment, teamwork, collaboration and imaginative adventure for children. Played healthily they contribute an essential part of children’s development and socialisation.
However, it’s important for parents to understand online gaming so they can encourage safe and healthy habits in children and technology from a young age.

<font color="magenta">Things you need to know about gaming</h2>
<p><font size="4"><font color="black">
Gaming is a fun and sociable way to spend time, encouraging teamwork and developing skills.
All good stuff, but there are a few things you need to be aware of:<p>
<font size="3"><font color="black">
<p style="text=align:left:">Some games let children play and chat with anyone in the world.This means they might come across offensive language and bullying.
Not everyone online is who they say they are.<p style="text=align:left:">
<p style="text=align:left:">Children should avoid giving out personal details that could identify them or their location.<p style="text=align:left:">
<p style="text=align:left:">Some games encourage players to buy extra elements during the game – children have been known to run up large bills without realising.<p style="text=align:left:">
<p style="text=align:left:">In extreme cases bullying, also known as ‘griefing’, can be used as a tactic to win games. Children may find themselves either bullying or being bullied.<p style="text=align:left:">
<p style="text=align:left:">Get involved by finding out what type of games your child enjoys and making sure they’re appropriate for their age.<p style="text=align:left:">
<p style="text=align:left:">It can be hard to stop some games in the middle of a battle as there are penalties for quitting and children may feel they are letting teammates down.<p style="text=align:left:">
